========    INSTALLATION    ========

Use TI Connect or TiLP to download INSANE.8xp to your calculator. That's it!

To play, you can run prgmINSANE from the home screen or from any popular shell.



========    MENU    ========

During the intro screens, you can hold DEL (or any other key that repeats,
namely the arrow keys) to skip the frames.

GAME:

	This enters the game menu. PLAY starts a new game; LOAD loads a saved game
	(if it exists); EDIT enters the level editor, where you can create your own
	Insanity levels; and BACK takes you back to the main menu.

HIGH:

	This is just a high score table. If you finish the game, you'll be able to
	put your name and high score here.

RULE:

	Some in-game tips and hopeless self-promotion from the author of this game.



========    GAMEPLAY    ========

Your goal is to get to the other side. Arrows move, 2nd fires your weapon, ENTER
pauses (and resumes) the game, CLEAR quits the game, and >STO saves your
progress.

You can safely land on anything with a flat top. Hit the spikes from the wrong
side, or go through an enemy, an enemy's bullet spray, or a smiley face, and you
lose a life. Powerups (with a cross symbol) add both points and range to your
gun; get enough points and you gain a life.



========    EDITOR    ========

Absolute Insanity has external level support. Under the GAME menu, the EDIT
option opens up the level editor. Navigate with the arrow keys, add a block with
its numerical value (press ZOOM for the HELP screen for block options), and use
DEL to remove a block.

To save a level, press TRACE. There are three slots (lists) where you can save
custom levels, named with INED followed by a number 1, 2, or 3. Once you save a
level, you can import it with the OPEN screen (WINDOW). GRAPH starts the game
with your custom level.

If you have any levels you think worthy of inclusion into a future level pack,
send me the lists at ti.42.plus@gmail.com!



========    FILES    ========

Absolute Insanity uses several variables, some of which are useful for future
gameplay.

INSANE:

	Program INSANE contains the entire game. If you want to keep playing, please
	don't delete it (for obvious reasons).

INSAV:

	This list contains all saved data, so don't delete it if you want to load
	previously saved games. Deleting it will simply empty the LOAD game menu.
	Please do not have this archived.

INSCR:

	This list has all your high scores. Deleting it will clear the high score
	table, but the game will still run fine. Please do not have this archived.

Levels:

	Custom levels are lists with names starting with INED followed by a number
	1, 2, or 3. The appropriate level list must exist to import a level through
	the OPEN command in the level editor.

All other variables are temporary, and you may delete them at any time to free
up more memory. Please do not archive any variables used by the game, or else it
may not run.



========    HINTS    ========

There are spoilers in this section!

When you get to the later levels, look closely at the solid blocks. If it's
missing a row of pixels on either side, it's a secret entryway! That's all I'll
give you for now.
