Hello user, welcome to the amazing experience of APT - Advanced Powder Toy !

This program permits you to have fun with minimalistic graphics : some pixels, bombs and converters !

Send PWDRTOY.8xp to your TI-83+/84+ (SRCTHRST.8xp is the source) and run Asm(prgmPWDRTOY) on your calculator to begin the experiment !

As the title screen will tell you, there's absolutely no other point than having fun with pixels. Let's detail a bit what you'll find in there :

Keys :
Arrow keys : move your cursor
[2nd] : draw an environment square
[alpha] : remove an environment square
[mode] : creates a cell of the current cell state
[x,t,O,n] : kills all cells
[del] : destroy all environment
[stat] : places an object
[clear] : shamelessly quit the experiment
[F1][F3][F5] : set the cell state to solid, liquid or gas respectively
[F2][F4] : move to the previous or next object respectively

Cell types :
Solid : cell is affected by physics and gravity.
Liquid : cell is not affected by physics, but is affected by gravity. Unless it's stuck, it will always keep moving.
Gas : cell is affected by physics but not gravity. Instead, it will continuously go up until it gets stuck on a wall. See that like an upward gravity.

Objects :
All objects stays active a limited amount of time after you placed them.
Grenade : a grenade will explode a few instants after you placed it, blowing all living cells away. This is how you move cells.
Freezer : a cell that gets in contact with this instantly become solid.
Liquifier : a cell that gets in contact with this instantly become liquid.
Gasifier : a cell that gets in contact with this instantly become - guess what ? - gas.

And that's pretty much it. Hope you'll have fun with this !
