I) Introduction

	Snake is a game that everyone can enjoy.  I made this game because I wanted to make a 
snake game with Axe Parser, and I think it turned out really well.  This was also my first game 
with greyscale. =)


II) Instructions
	
	Put prgmAxeSnake on your calc, and enjoy.
	The instructions are simple: On the main menu, choose difficulty with the arrows, select 
with [2nd], or quit out with clear.  Once the game is over, you will receive your score, and be 
alerted if it is a highscore.  If it is, you must type your name.  You will then go back to the 
main menu.
	There are 5 difficulty settings that are changed by pressing left and right on the main 
menu.  There are separate highscores for each difficulty setting.
	It creates the AppVar AxeSnake to save your high scores.  If you've archived the AppVar, 
it will put it back in archive when the game quits.

III) Controls

	Use [2nd] to advance through all screens, except in-game, where it is used to pause.  
Un-pause with [2nd].
	Use [Clear] to quit from the main menu, return to the main menu if you're paused, and to
clear the name that you're entering in if you get a high score.
	Use [Del] to clear your high scores and as backspace when typing.
	Use the arrows to move around.
	Use all the keys with letters above them to type.

IV) Errors

	There are no known bugs or errors in the program!

V) Conclusion

	Thank you for downloading this game.  It was coded in the Axe Parser language 
(www.axe.omnimaga.org) and compiled with Axe 0.3.2 for Ion.  Enjoy, and please try my other games!

VI) Thanks
	Edward H:  For making Nibbles http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/archives:nibbles It was the
biggest inspiration for this game.  Thanks!
	The Penguin 77:  For making awesome games!  The title screen was inspired by your games.  
They are all great, so while you're at it, look at all of his games as well! =)
	Quigibo:  Thanks for making Axe.  It's a wonderful language that is easy to code, yet fast.
Without you, this game wouldn't be here.
	Everyone at Omnimaga:  Your support is great.  Omnimaga is the best calc forum out there!


Thanks for playing!
