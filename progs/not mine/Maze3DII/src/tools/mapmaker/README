Mapmaker reference

USAGE:

mapmaker reads a source file from stdin and writes an include file to stdout.

example:

mapmaker <map.txt >map.inc

SOURCE FORMAT:

A map source file is a plain text file.

Lines starting with ``.'' are special directives.
A directive consists of a dot, a single character indicating the
directive, and the rest of the line is treated as a parameter.

..	Comment, rest of line is ignored
.I	Include, parameter is the name of the file to include
.X	Set X coordinate to the parameter
.Y	Set Y coordinate to the parameter
.W	Set map width to the parameter
.H	Set map height to the parameter
.D	Define the the first character of the parameter to a value

Non-directive lines are treated as data, with characters converted
to numbers as specified in the .D directives.  Characters that
have not been defined have the value ``0''.

Example:

..This is a comment
..Make a 4x4 map
.W4
.H4
..x means 0, a means 7
.Dx0
.Da7
aa a
axxa
axxa
aaaa

This map file generates the data:

 .db $07,$07,$00,$07,$07,$00,$00,$07,$07,$00,$00,$07,$07,$07,$07,$07

NOTE: Mach3D maps MUST be 16x16
