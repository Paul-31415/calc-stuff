Texmaker Documentation

USAGE:

texmaker reads a 24-bit color PPM file from stdin
and writes a plain text include file to stdout.

texmaker can also produce transparency information if enabled by ``-t''

Example usage:

texmaker <walltextures.ppm >walltextures.inc

texmaker -t <spritetexture.ppm >spritetexture.inc

INPUT FORMAT:

Plain old binary PPM format.
If you need a program that can save PPMs, try the GIMP.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Coming "soon", read the code for now.
