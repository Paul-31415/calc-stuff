Things to improve:

1. The Makefile

Currently, the makefile is unclear to read and difficult to maintain.
It may also have a few bugs.  Makefile wizards are welcome to clean it up.

2. Labels, Comments, and Documentation

Labels should be rewritten in a consistent style,
e.g. UpperCaseWords or underscore_separation.
In light of TASM's 16-character limit on macro arguments,
UpperCaseWords seems the most sensible.

Prefixes should be consistently used to identify what
part of the program a label applies to.

Documentation was written at the last minute and could use everything
from a spelling/grammar check to a complete rewrite.

3. Drawing pixels

Currently, the 3D Engine's main bottleneck is its ability
to draw columns of walls.  A faster method of resizing and
drawing these columns would lead to substantial speed increases.
