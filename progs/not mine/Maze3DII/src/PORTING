You are welcome to port this code to other systems.
Systems that maze3DII could probably be ported to:
TI-82
TI-83
TI-83+se
TI-84

Assumptions in the code that may break when porting:

* Time-delay code in Mach3DFlip assumes a 6MHz processor and an LCD driver with certain minimum delay between commands.

* gBuf is assumed to be divisible by 64

* Certain TI-83+ system functions are called to reserve and free memory
