Exodus is an extremely fun yet difficult puzzler/platformer for the TI-83/84 series calculators. There are 24 levels that should provide endless amounts of fun. Upon first glance Exodus looks like most other games released for the calculator, with monochrome graphics and loading times, but it includes many features rarely seen in Basic games: Enemies that you must avoid and shoot to advance to the next level, Gems you must collect, A flag you need get to in order to finish each level. If that's not enough, there are also switches that control a tile that toggles it between solid and clear whenever you shoot the switch. There are crumbling blocks that disappear after you've stepped on them more than once and spikes that you cannot land on. There is also a world map even customizable options. Also, the entire game is in only one program so it is easier to keep track of. Exodus is one of the best games ever coded in the TI-Basic language and a must try.

Hints:
The enemies move across the solid platforms only and turn around whenever they cannot go any further.
The enemies ooze across the platform when they die.  Make sure you're not on the same platform with them when you shoot them.
Remember, [Alpha] turns around.
You must shoot all the enemies, collect all the gems and then go to the flag to compleat the level.
The 3x3 pattern in the middle of the switches corresponds to the 3x3 pattern in the tile they control.
Collision detection is handled horizontally then vertically.
If you or an ememy is on top of or in the location the switch would open/close on, the switch will not change the block.
