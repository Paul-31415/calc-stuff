Thank you for downloading Fruit Ninja. This game is a clone of
[that game](http://www.fruitninja.com/), or at least its Classic Mode. Yeah,
that game, the one by Halfbrick Studios. You know that game. This game was
compiled using Axe 1.1.2. Enjoy!

CHANGELOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+   **2012-12-10**

    Added features to clear high scores and pause in-game

+   **2012-08-30**

    Major bugfix involving high-score saving

+   **2012-05-23**

    First version released

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use TI Connect or TiLP to download FRUIT.8xp to your calculator. That's it!

To play, you can run Asm(prgmFRUIT from the home screen or start it from any
popular shell supporting the Ion format, including Ion, MirageOS, and DoorsCS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you start the game, you're presented with the title screen. Swipe your
finger across the keypad horizontally to begin.

Press DEL at the menu to clear your the current high score.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAMEPLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gameplay in this Fruit Ninja game is designed to simulate playing Fruit Ninja on
a touchscreen device, including the touch part. The entire bottom section of
your keypad, from the MATH/APPS/PRGM/VARS/CLEAR row downwards, is now a giant
touchpad. It's mapped to the screen, with the row containing MATH being the top-
left corner of the screen and ENTER being the bottom-right.

Try swiping your finger across it, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Keep your swipes smooth and try to press down on only one key at a time. You may
find it easiest to use the tip of your index finger to swipe. Don't try swiping
with more than one finger at a time. It won't work.

You can watch a video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhDquSJ2Rr8 of the game
in action.

Press DEL in the game to pause and unpause.

This is meant to be as close a clone to the original game's Classic Mode as
possible. Slice a fruit to get a point. If you hit a bomb, you instantly lose.
If you drop three unsliced fruit, you also lose. If you slice three or more
fruit in one swipe, you get a bonus worth the number of fruit you sliced in that
swipe.

Unfortunately, there are no pomegranates in this version.
